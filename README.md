# Plant-Irrigation
Arduino Backyard Plant Irrigation project

I had originally intended this to be a desktop setup for my plants, however due to the size of the hoses and the valve minimum pressure requirments the project quickly became impractical. To manage a test run I had to pressurize the line, I did this with a bike valve glued into a milk jug. This project would run just fine in an outdoor/backyard setting where one might just connect it to a spigot instead. The code is the shining jewel of this project. I learned much by way of writing interacting functions and handling the two different interupts required to run the hall effect flow meter and the power down/up alarms.  

Check out the quick and dirty test run of the project here:
